This is my Homework 3 submission written in Python
I found tutorials on how to set it up from Kulkarni's PDF	

Put Homework3.py into a directory you'll remember.

Open up your command line/terminal and navigate to the directory you placed Homework3.py.

After being in the correct directory, simply type, 'python Homework3.py'

The program should now be up and running.

Remember that if you change the name of Homework3.py, be sure to change your command	line code as well to make sure the file runs.

Example:

'python "new_filename.py"'
